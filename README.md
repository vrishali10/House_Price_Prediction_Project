# House_Price_Prediction_Project
The objective of this project is to predict the median house price of houses in californina beased of the data provided. The data that has been provided consists o informatin like latitude and longitude of the districts, median income, ocean proximity etc. To predict the median house price, we are using regression models like linear regressor, decision tree regressor and random forest regressor. Random forest regressor produces the greatest outcomes. We tuned hyperparameter values using GridSearchCV in order to determine the optimal values for random forest regressor.
